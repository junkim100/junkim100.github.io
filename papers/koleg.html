            Korean legal knowledge is subject to frequent temporal updates
            driven by societal needs and government policies. Even minor
            modifications to legal provisions can have significant consequences,
            yet continuously retraining large language models (LLMs) to
            incorporate such updates is resource-intensive and impractical. To
            address this, we propose KoLEG, an on-the-fly Korean Legal knowledge
            editing framework enhanced with continuous retrieval. KoLEG employs
            an Editing-Aware Learning Strategy and a LawEdit Retriever, which
            together adaptively integrate subtle linguistic nuances and
            continuous legislative amendments. To support this task, we
            construct the Korean Legislative Amendment Dataset, explicitly
            designed for continuous legal knowledge updates with attention to
            both temporal dynamics and linguistic subtleties. KoLEG outperforms
            existing locate-then-edit and retrieval-based editing methods,
            demonstrating superior effectiveness in legal knowledge editing
            while preserving linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, KoLEG
            maintains robust performance in sequential editing, improves
            performance on precedent application tasks, and is qualitatively
            validated by legal experts.
