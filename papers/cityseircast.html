            The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the importance of
            developing simulation systems for quickly characterizing and
            providing spatio-temporal forecasts of infection spread dynamics
            that take specific accounts of the population and spatial
            heterogeneities that govern pathogen transmission in real-world
            communities. Developing such computational systems must also
            overcome the cold-start problem related to the inevitable scarce
            early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogen's
            transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population
            behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe
            how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or
            virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular,
            agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and
            social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to
            provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral
            spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows
            are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can
            implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile
            enough to address different population settings and indeed,
            diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can
            provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic
            predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the
            state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of
            vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the
            impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of
            population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence.
